## Phonebook
This project was created to function as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, number, 
and email address in a database and allows users to update and delete their phonebook.

## Check Files Gui
This project checks if the files inside a selected folder have been modified in the last 24 hours, and if they have
been, those files will be transered to a selected destination folder.
